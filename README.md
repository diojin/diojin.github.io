# Welcome to my Homepage

<b>This is my homepage, it now has some technical documents and code snippets. It is still under construction, more are being added, in this sense, it is on the road, and it never ends. </b>

It was born on March 1st, 2018. Most of its content were added since a year ago. 

The documents cover many fields in Java EE, big data, algorithms and etc, as well as some materials quoted from books I've read, besides, there are many code snippets embedded in them, many of which are either reusable or for later reference.

The code snippets are in the same scope as the documents, majority of which are sample codes from other books as of now, and some algorithms I practiced. There are still a lot of codes I didn't sort out yet, I will try to add some valuable ones, as well as new interesting codes later.

Here are some of my projects with brief introduction, for more information, you can just [navigate to each project through the links below](#mockingjay).

### [mockingjay]
There are all my documents covering topics such as Java SE/Java EE, big data, multi-threading, database, algorithm and etc, as well as my code snippets. There are indeed quite some documents, and some of them contains topics such as  performance tuning.

### [doodles-scala]
There are some scala sample codes, as well as algorithms on sorting, tree, graph, string, and etc. 

### [doodles]
This is a project collections, contains 4 projects
* doodles-spring
* doodles-hibernate
* doodles-scripts
    There are perl, shell scripts, as well as design pattern written in UML diagram.
* doodles-gemfire

### [doodles-python]
There are some algorithms written in python, including sorting, tree, graph, string, and etc.
