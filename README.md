# Welcome to Dio's Homepage

<h2>This is my homepage, it now has some technical documents and code snippets. It is still under construction, more are being added, in this sense, it is on the road, and it never ends. </h2>

It was born on March 1st, 2018, however, most of its content were added since a year ago. 

The documents cover many fields in Java EE, big data, algorithms and etc, as well as some materials quoted from books I've read, besides, there are many code snippets embedded in them, many of which are either reusable or for later reference.

The code snippets are in the same scope as the documents, majority of which are sample codes from other books as of now, and some algorithms I practiced. There are still a lot of codes I didn't sort out yet, I will try to add some valuable ones, as well as new interesting codes later.

You can use  for all my documents and some of my code snippets.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/diojin/diojin.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
